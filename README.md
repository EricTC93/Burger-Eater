# Burger-Eater

This application lets the user make and eat hamburgers displayed to the page. The hamburgers on the page are displayed using handlebars based on the attributes gathered from the mysql server. Burgers that have yet to be eaten are displayed on the left with a devor button while burgers that are eaten are displayed on the right. Clicking a burger chages the data on the sever and updates the page.
